FlexiBLE was designed for researchers, and it's out of the box functionality is built for rapid prototyping of embedded systems.</p> <p>FlexiBLE reduces the engineering effort needed to prototype with embedded systems. FlexiBLE solves a problem of wiring tons of repetitive code to enable bi-directional communication with embedded systems over BLE. For example extracting time series data from sensors, updating on-device run-time parameters. See our use-cases for more in-depth examples of how FlexiBLE can be applied. </p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Watch this video to see how the initial motivation of FlexiBLE in the context of wearable health devices.</p>"},{"location":"#high-level-system-overview","title":"High-Level System Overview","text":"<p>This video explains a non-technical high-level system concepts of FlexiBLE.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-flexible","title":"What is FlexiBLE?","text":"<p>FlexiBLE is a toolkit for rapid prototyping of embedded systems, and it is in active development (see roadmap).
