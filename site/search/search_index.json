FlexiBLE was designed for researchers, and it's out of the box functionality is built for rapid prototyping of embedded systems.</p> <p>FlexiBLE reduces the engineering effort needed to prototype with embedded systems. FlexiBLE solves a problem of wiring tons of repetitive code to enable bi-directional communication with embedded systems over BLE. For example extracting time series data from sensors, updating on-device run-time parameters. See our use-cases for more in-depth examples of how FlexiBLE can be applied. </p>"},{"location":"#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Watch this video to see how the initial motivation of FlexiBLE in the context of wearable health devices.</p>"},{"location":"#quick-demo","title":"Quick Demo","text":"<p>This video shows a quick demo of FlexiBLE in action using a reseach focused device for multi-wavelength PPG.</p>"},{"location":"#high-level-system-overview","title":"High-Level System Overview","text":"<p>This video explains a non-technical high-level system concepts of FlexiBLE.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-flexible","title":"What is FlexiBLE?","text":"<p>FlexiBLE is a toolkit for rapid prototyping of embedded systems, and it is in active development (see roadmap).

However, it can be used as a starting point for any BLE-enabled embedded project. In addition, FlexiBLE requires some knowledge of embedded systems. At a bare minimum a understanding of Arduino, our most popular supported-system, is required.</p> <p>While FlexiBLE lives in the Internet-of-Things, it is not all encompassing. Specifically, FlexiBLE is primarily for localized sensor data collection and prototyping. FlexiBLE is not designed for large scale deployment and centralized data collection (e.g., cloud-based). However some tooling is provided for aggregation of multiple device's data.</p>"},{"location":"authors/","title":"Contributions","text":""},{"location":"authors/#core-team","title":"Core Team","text":""},{"location":"authors/#organization-support","title":"Organization Support","text":""},{"location":"authors/#contributors","title":"Contributors","text":""},{"location":"authors/#how-to-contribute","title":"How to Contribute","text":""},{"location":"roadmap/","title":"FlexiBLE Roadmap","text":""},{"location":"roadmap/#versions","title":"Versions","text":"<ul> <li>Alpha internal releases</li> <li>0.4.0 (planned: October 1st, 2023)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"supported-systems/","title":"FlexiBLE Supported Systems","text":"<p>This page lists the currently supported systems (and those planning or in development). </p> Note <p>FlexiBLE is designed to be system agnostic.
