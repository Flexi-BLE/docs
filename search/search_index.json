See motivation to learn more about why we built FlexiBLE. If you want to build a custom embedded system, and you want to be able to easily change its behavior on the fly or collect data from the device, then FlexiBLE is for you. See use-cases for more detailed applications.</p>"},{"location":"#but-what-does-it-do","title":"But what does it do?","text":"<p>FlexiBLE reduces the engineering effort needed to prototype with embedded systems. It does this by providing a set of tools to build a dynamic interface to adjust the behavior and collect data from your device(s). These tools are built around a Device Interaction Model which is used to generate an Interface Library to drive functionality of FlexiBLE's client applications. FlexiBLE is by no means an \"out-of-the-box\" or \"no-code\" solution to building embedded systems, it aims to bridge the gap between toy educational tools and completely custom embedded systems helping you build new computational things.

However, it can be used as a starting point for any BLE-enabled embedded project. In addition, FlexiBLE requires some knowledge of embedded systems. At a bare minimum a understanding of Arduino, our most popular supported-system, is required.</p> <p>While FlexiBLE lives in the Internet-of-Things, it is not all encompassing. Specifically, FlexiBLE is primarily for localized sensor data collection and prototyping. FlexiBLE is not designed for large scale deployment and centralized data collection (e.g., cloud-based). However some tooling is provided for aggregation of multiple device's data.</p>"},{"location":"faq/","title":"FAQs","text":""},{"location":"faq/#why-ble","title":"Why BLE?","text":"<p>FlexiBLE was originally developed to assit in the development of wearable devices (see motivation) where BLE is the prominent form of communication. However, we still believe that BLE is extremely important to most general-purpose embedded systems. BLE is a low-power, low-cost, and low-complexity communication protocol that is widely supported by modern devices. BLE is also a well-defined standard, which makes it easy to develop for. In addition, BLE's structure and constraints provides a good starting point for communication support. </p> <p>However, as we expand the applications of FlexiBLE, we realize a need to support more communication protocols, such as WiFi, Cellular, and LoRa, see roadmap and releases for more information.</p>"},{"location":"faq/#how-do-i-get-involved","title":"How do I get involved?","text":"<p>We are always, always, always looking for contributors.

This project included novel sensor exploration and algorithmic development from a device inside various face masks during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collecting raw sensor data and developing new algorithms in embedded environment turned out to be a tedious engineering task spanning multiple codebases and requiring slow developmental iterations.
