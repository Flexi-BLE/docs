# FlexiBLE Supported Systems

This page lists the currently supported systems (and those planning or in development). 

???+ note

    FlexiBLE is designed to be system agnostic. This means even if a system is not supported here, it can still be used with FlexiBLE given it meets the [system requirements](), it just may require custom coding. If you are working with FlexiBLE on a environment not listed here, please consider [contributing](authors.md) to the project!
