# Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

We are not going to attempt to explain BLE here, there are many great resources diving into BLE. What we will do is provide a list of resource that has helped us in the path to build FlexiBLE. It's best to tackle the concepts of BLE in tiers, but it is up to you which order to ingest this information, or which ones you skipped. We define these teirs as:
* **Bluetooth History**: Where did Bluetooth/BLE come from and what problems does it solve? (**non-technical**) 
* **Bluetooth Basics**: What is BLE and how does it work from a high-level technical perspecitive
* **BLE Basics**: What is the difference between Bluetooth Classic and BLE?
* **BLE Advanced**: How does BLE work under the hood? What are the different layers of BLE?
* **BLE Implementation**: How do I implement BLE in my application?
