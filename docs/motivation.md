# Motivation
FlexiBLE was originally developed to fill a need in prototyping exploratory werable devices. It was envisioned from lessons learned in developing [FaceBit: A Platform for Smart Facemaks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3494991). This project included novel sensor exploration and algorithmic development from a device inside various face masks during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Collecting raw sensor data and developing new algorithms in embedded environment turned out to be a tedious engineering task spanning multiple codebases and requiring slow developmental iterations. These lessons and an initial proof-of-concept of FlexiBLE is outline in the paper [Towards a Toolkit for Free Living Wearable Development](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3544793.3560399).

## Expanding beyond wearables
We quickly realized that FlexiBLE shouldn't be constrained to wearable technology, and that really any embedded device can benefit from rapid prototyping. We are currently working to expand out [use-cases](use-cases.md), targeting education, and environmental sensor development.
