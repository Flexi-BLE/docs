# **FlexiBLE**: Easing Embedded Interactions

FlexiBLE is a **open-source** toolkit enabling flexible interaction with embedded systems over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), hence the name FlexiBLE. FlexiBLE was designed for researchers, and it's out of the box functionality is built for rapid prototyping of embedded systems.

**FlexiBLE reduces the engineering effort needed to prototype with embedded systems**. FlexiBLE solves a problem of wiring tons of repetitive code to enable bi-directional communication with embedded systems over BLE. For example extracting time series data from sensors, updating on-device run-time parameters. See our [use-cases](use-cases.md) for more in-depth examples of how FlexiBLE can be applied.

## What is FlexiBLE?
FlexiBLE is a toolkit for rapid prototyping of embedded systems, and it is in active development (see [roadmap](roadmap.md)). FlexiBLE is built within the constraints of Bluetooth specifications, and it is designed to be used with any BLE enabled device (see [system requirements]()). What FlexiBLE does it make it convenient to build custom interaction with BLE.

Tools have been developed to help with the development of BLE embedded system on different devices (see [supported-systems]())
