## Why BLE?
FlexiBLE was originally developed to assit in the development of wearable devices (see [motivation](motivation.md)) where BLE is the prominent form of communication. However, we still believe that BLE is extremely important to most general-purpose embedded systems. BLE is a low-power, low-cost, and low-complexity communication protocol that is widely supported by modern devices. BLE is also a well-defined standard, which makes it easy to develop for. In addition, BLE's structure and constraints provides a good starting point for communication support. 

However, as we expand the applications of FlexiBLE, we realize a need to support more communication protocols, such as WiFi, Cellular, and LoRa, see [roadmap](roadmap.md) and [releases](release-notes/index.md) for more information.

## How do I get involved?
We are always, always, **always** looking for contributors. FlexiBLE is built to be extensible and many of its components are determinant on trailblazers to implement a first iteration. If you are interested in contributing **in any way**, please see our [contributions page](contributing/team.md) for more information.
